# Linear-Regression-model-on-Irish-dataset

In Irish dataset their are four features such as Sepal length,Sepal Width,Petal length and Petal width.
In a linear regression model we put any of the one freatures in dependent variable and other features in independent variable.

In this project first we put Sepal width in independent variable and predict the Sepal length.we get mean_squared_error value 0.6914946986592403
In multiple Regression model we put all the features expect sepal length in independent variable and predict the Sepal Length.In second model we get mean_squared_error value is 0.11900090701234599.

# Conclusion
From above we can say that the mean squared error value of second model is less than the first and multiple Regression model gives great mean_squared_value.
Hence the second model is good for prediction and gives nearly accurate prediction.
